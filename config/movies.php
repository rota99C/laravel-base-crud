            'description' => 'New York City, 1978. The 20 blocks of pawnshops, porn palaces and dive bars between 8th Avenue and the Hudson River owned by the Irish mafia and known as Hell’s Kitchen was never the easiest place to live. Or the safest. But for mob wives Kathy, Ruby and Claire—played by Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish, and Elisabeth Moss—things are about to take a radical, dramatic turn. When their husbands are sent to prison by the FBI, the women take business into their own hands, running the rackets and taking out the competition…literally. 

            Now they own the neighborhood.
             
            The gritty, female-driven mob drama The Kitchen, from New Line Cinema and BRON Creative, is written and directed by Andrea Berloff, who was nominated for an Oscar for Original Screenplay for Straight Outta Compton.
             
            The film also stars Domhnall Gleeson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi), James Badge Dale (Only the Brave), Brian d’Arcy James (Spotlight), with Margo Martindale (TV’s The Americans), Oscar winner Common (Selma, Marshall), and Bill Camp (Vice), with an  ensemble cast including Jeremy Bobb (Marshall), E.J. Bonilla (TV’s The Long Road Home), Wayne Duvall (Prisoners), Annabella Sciorra (TV’s Daredevil), Myk Watford (HBO’s True Detective). 
             
            Berloff’s screenplay was based on the comic book series created for DC Vertigo by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle. The film was produced by multiple Oscar nominee Michael De Luca (Captain Phillips, Moneyball, The Social Network) and Marcus Viscidi (Rampage). Serving as executive producers were Richard Brener, Michael Disco, Dave Neustadter, Aaron L. Gilbert, Jason Cloth, Elishia Holmes, and Adam Schlagman.
             
            The creative filmmaking team included director of photography Maryse Alberti (Creed), production designer Shane Valentino (Straight Outta Compton), Oscar-nominated editor Christopher Tellefsen (Moneyball, A Quiet Place) and costume designer Sarah Edwards (Ocean’s 8, Showtime’s Billions). The music was composed by Bryce Dessner.
             
            Principal photography took place primarily in and around the film’s setting, New York City’s famed Hell’s Kitchen.

            'description' => 'When the Teen Titans go to the big screen, they go big! Teen Titans GO! to the Movies finds our egocentric, wildly satirical superheroes in their first feature film extravaganza—a fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the superhero genre, complete with musical numbers.

            It seems to the Teens that all the major superheroes out there are starring in their own movies—everyone but the Teen Titans, that is! But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick. If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them. With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream. But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously super villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry. The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line!',
